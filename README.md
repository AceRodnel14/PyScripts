# PyScripts

MOST OF THE SCRIPTS WERE CREATED WITH THE HELP OF AI. THE COMMANDS/ FUNCTIONS USED ARE SUGGESTED BY AI. I WORKED ON THE LOGIC AND FLOW OF THINGS.

This repository is the archive of various (sometimes random) Python scripts that I have. Some are still used. Some are maintained/ updated when bugs are caught.
